          She's the smart one of the two. Recent Gonzaga grad, Bailey has moved 
          on from the lilac city to Seattle. She will spend the next 3 years
          studying at the University of Washington School of Law.
          She is one of the most creative and passionate people you'll ever meet. She is regularly
          seen reading, scrapbooking, or taking care of her plants. Ever met someone who genuinely 
          likes reading old english classics? She might be the only one.

          Recent college grad out of Gonzaga University, Brandon likes spending most of his 
          freetime hanging out with his girlfriend, Bailey. (I was forced to say this)
          Best known for his obsession with Kpop Demon Hunters, it is truly a wonder
          this guy found a girlfriend.

        Whatever the case, we are the cutest couple 😊
