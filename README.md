# This is my first attempt at creating a website for my girlfriend. 
This is my 1 year anniversary gift. 
This project has several goals:
* create a cute and personal gift
* learn node.js
* practice and learn html and css
My girlfriend loves making cute artsy gifts for me. For our anniversary, she ended up making a cute scrapbook cataloging our first year together.
In a similar vein, I want my website to reflect our amazing journey together. To do this, this project will have:
* A home page
* About page
* photos page
## Home Page
This will the landing page for new users. It will have a short description of the website, with atleast one couple photo
## About Page
A brief overview of our relationship. This page will also go over the biggest adventures we've been through, including segments on our Banff trip, Prague, etc
## Photo Page
This section will have several of our photos from throughout the year, followed by a description of the photo. The images will be ordered by upload date
